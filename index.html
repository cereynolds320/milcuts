        <br>
    <p5>Dear President Jim Reynolds and Provost Mary Black,</p5>
    <br>
    <br>

<p5>We, the concerned students of Millikin University, are writing to communicate our immense disappointment that the University is considering drastic cuts to faculty lines and programs. We acknowledge that serious cuts must be made, but we question both the process being followed to make these cuts, and the validity of the data the cuts are based on. When we chose to make it Millikin, we made that choice because we believed Millikin would put our educational needs first. We placed our trust in you to cultivate an environment that would foster academic growth and professional development. If you choose to go through with these cuts, you will have betrayed that trust. The very fact that these cuts are being considered is enough to make us question the wisdom of depending on Millikin University to provide us with the educational experience we need.</p5>
    <br>
    <br>
<p5>The so-called "teach-out programs" being proposed offer no solace. No arrangement can equal the education we would be receiving without these cuts. Bottom line: when we decided to make it Millikin, we made that decision based on the resources we knew would be available to us at Millikin, and those resources include faculty. To promise students one educational experience and deliver a severely diminished one is nothing short of false advertising.</p5>
    <br>
    <br>
<p5>The proposed cuts have left us feeling as though you view us merely as walking wallets to bankroll this university, rather than as pupils that you have a responsibility to educate. We realize that you believe the proposed cuts will protect Millikin, but we implore you to consider the fact that you may simply be giving up exactly what makes Millikin, Millikin.</p5>
    <br>
    <br>
<p5>Regardless of the decision the Board comes to, we want you to know that the proposed cuts have irrevocably changed the way we view Millikin University, which is for the worse.
</p5>
<br>
    <br>
          <p2>This email was composed by several students in an effort to express our feelings about the University's approach to academic restructuring. It is not an attempt to represent the feelings of all Millikin University students; it is only meant to serve as a quick and easy way for students to communicate their thoughts to University administration if they so choose.</p2>
